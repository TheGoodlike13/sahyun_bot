The following functionality will be implemented with future versions, if needed:

Background tasks: automatic indexing, checking of hosts, checking of current watchers
Automatic CDLC download from supported websites into pre-configured folder
Fallback implementation for CDLC search (similar to the original bot, querying the website)
Sub & mod support
Improve queue by managing already played songs more explicitly

Post-fix cleanup, if needed:
Add support for multiple tunings
Add support for mac-only CDLCs
Cleanup tuning values (old vs new)
Make CDLC loading use dates explicitly instead of timestamps
