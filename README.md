# Sahyun bot

This is the implementation of the bot used in Sahyun's twitch channel:
https://www.twitch.tv/sahyun

## Usage example

> !request acdc highway to hell
>> Your request for \<acdc highway to hell> is now in position 1
>>
>> To pick exact:
>> !1 AC/DC - Highway to Hell (Brooklyn_Sounds);
>> !2 AC/DC - Highway to hell (gizmo);
>> !3 AC/DC - Highway to Hell (fetal_icecream)
>>
> !1
>> Your request for (LRBV) AC/DC - Highway to Hell (Brooklyn_Sounds) is now in position 1
>>
> !next
>> Next: (LRBV) AC/DC - Highway to Hell (Brooklyn_Sounds) by ADMIN sahyun
>>
> !random acdc
>> Your request for (LRBV) AC/DC - ThunderStruck (rGUNSLINGERr) is now in position 1

## Permissions

Customsforge does not allow bots to access their API, unless given explicit permission.
This bot's use of Customsforge API has been officially approved with the condition that the
source code is made public on Github.

If you want to access their API using this bot (or build your own), please contact them and ask:
http://customsforge.com/page/support.html

## Command reference

Commands have the following attributes:
* aliases - different ways to call the command
* expected args - parameters for the command
* shorthands - similar to alias, but automatically sets a parameter
* minimum user rank - any user with lower rank cannot use the command

The reference below splits the commands by their minimum user rank. Each command will be
described by a comma separated list of aliases, followed by expected args (uppercase).
Every alias supports the same args. Args are usually delimited by spaces, and any unexpected
args are always ignored. Exceptional cases will always be documented.

##### No commands are available for users with rank BAN.

### VWR (any viewer that is not a follower)

#### !commands

Prints all commands available to the user's rank.

#### !last

Prints the last song that was popped from the queue.

#### !playlist, !list

Prints the request queue. If the queue is big, may choose to print only some top elements.

#### !time

Responds with current time in UTC.

#### !joke

Tells the most awesome joke ever.

#### !hosts

Prints the list of hosts for the channel.

### FLWR (follower)

#### !request, !song, !sr QUERY

Adds any matching songs to the request queue. Query is taken as a literal search string. Can be empty.

If multiple matches are found, you will be able to use !pick to choose the most relevant ones.

The following rules do NOT apply to ADMIN rank:
* If you already had a song in the queue, replaces it instead.
* If the song is already in the queue, does not add it.
* If the song has been played already, does not add it.

#### !random QUERY

Same as !request, but automatically picks from ALL possible matches. This includes matches that cannot
be picked with !pick due to lower relevance. Usually best used with artists, e.g. !random acdc

#### !pick N

If a previous !request returned more than one match, this command allows to pick an exact match.

Picking an exact match is subject to the same rules as request.

Position can be used as a shorthand, e.g. instead of "!pick 1", you can just use "!1".

You can change your pick as long as it is still in the queue, unless you are ADMIN.
Instead, ADMIN can !pick for the last !next result, even if it's not theirs.
Pick for !next can be changed with a follow-up !pick.

#### !played

Prints all the requests in the request queue memory.

### ADMIN (streamer & his buddies)

#### !lock

Stops the bot from executing any further commands unless the user is ADMIN.

#### !index

Tries to index CDLCs from customsforge into elasticsearch.

#### !rank RANK NICK

Sets manual rank to the user.

Any rank can be used as a shorthand: !ban NICK, !admin NICK, etc.

#### !next

Pop the next song in request queue. After calling this, it is considered played.
If the request was not exact, ADMIN rank can then call !pick to make it exact.
Only the picked value will be considered played in that case.

#### !top NICK

Move the latest request by user with given nick to the top of the queue.

## Notes on development & running

The purpose of this bot is to manage the playlist of user requests while Sahyun is streaming.
It may also perform some other trivial tasks alongside.

For the sake of exercise, the bot is written using Python 3.8+. It uses poetry as build & dependency 
management tool.

install.bat should contain all the relevant commands & instructions which were used when setting up
the application for development & running. All instructions assume windows, as anyone using linux is
probably savvy enough to take care of such things on their own. Furthermore, most of the work is
described in guides & documentation of python or its tools. In some cases, information from a reddit
post was used:
https://www.reddit.com/r/pycharm/comments/elga2z/using_pycharm_for_poetrybased_projects/

To launch the bot, use 'run.bat'. To play around with the modules instead, use 'repl.bat'.
The latter should configure all relevant objects, but not actually launch the bot itself.
Both files assume 'install.bat' was already called before.

### Where to start looking at the code?

I suggest starting at 'modules.py' in 'sahyun_bot' package. It contains most if not all singletons
of the application, as well as imports to their configuration.

This module exists to make it easy to try things out with 'repl.bat'. It is only referenced by
'main' functions of the application, so it can be considered a kind of a bean factory.

### Elasticsearch

For data storage, Elasticsearch is used. This is because we require somewhat advanced search
functionality. Since we already need to use it, it seems meaningless to use another data
storage solution, in particular because no advanced relation-like logic is expected.

As long as Elasticsearch is running and reachable, the bot will configure the required
indexes and mappings. You can control the specifics via configuration.

### Logging

Messages that should appear to the user will be logged under WARNING. Messages that provide basic
information that the user may not need will be logged under INFO. Messages that provide detailed
information will be logged under DEBUG.

The logger names are derived by eliminating all '_' from the module name. Also, any 'utils_X' module
shares its logger name with 'X' module for simplicity. This is done to ensure a shortened logger
name is viably represented in console (see logging configuration).

### Configuration

All configuration should be put into 'config.ini' file. This file should be in the working
directory. Use 'empty_config.ini' as an example to quick-start your configuration.

If a specific configuration is missing from the file entirely, or is set to a value incompatible
with expected type (e.g. integer 'a'), default value is used. Same applies for values exceeding
constraints, like -1 or 500 when allowed values are in [1..100].
In most cases empty value is also replaced with the default, HOWEVER, there are some exceptions.

To be certain, please refer to the list of expected values & explanations below. If no default
is specified, assume it defaults to None. Generally speaking, if any values without defaults
are not provided, the related module will not function, or have limited functionality.

#### [customsforge]

Email = email for an account in customsforge.com

Password = password for an account in customsforge.com

BatchSize = amount of values returned per request; defaults to 100; allowed range: [1..100]

Timeout = amount of seconds before HTTP gives up and fails the request; defaults to 100;
any positive value is allowed; due to retry policy, this value can be effectively 3 times
larger; the website can be pretty laggy sometimes :)

CookieFilename = filename for cookie storage; defaults to '.cookie_jar'; speeds up login
process for subsequent launches of the bot; IF EMPTY - cookies are only stored in memory only;
to avoid clashing with tests, '.cookie_jar_test' is automatically replaced with default value

#### [twitch]

ClientId = client id for accessing twitch API

Secret = client secret for accessing twitch API

#### [users]

CacheFollows = amount of seconds to cache a live follower rank, defaults to 300;
any positive value is allowed

CacheViewers = amount of seconds to cache a live follower rank, defaults to 5;
any positive value is allowed

#### [elastic]

Host = host used by elasticsearch client; defaults to localhost; localhost is also used for tests

CustomsforgeIndex = name of index which will contain information about cdlcs; defaults to 'cdlcs';
if you set it to 'cdlcs_test', which is used by tests, the application will crash immediately

RankIndex = name of index which will contain manual user ranks; defaults to 'users';
if you set it to 'users_test', which is used by tests, the application will crash immediately

Fuzziness = parameter used to account for spelling mistakes; defaults to 'auto:5,11';
this setting means that words length 1-4 will not allow for spelling mistakes,
words length 5-10 will allow a single spelling mistake and words length 11 or more allow
for two spelling mistakes

ShingleCeiling = amount of shingle mergers to use for searching; defaults to 3; any number
larger than 2 is OK; to keep it simple: when requesting "ac dc", it will only match "acdc"
if shingle ceiling is 2 or more; similarly when requesting "gunsnroses", it will only
match "guns n' roses" if shingle ceiling is 3 or more; the higher the ceiling the bigger
the index, the slower the search and less accurate the results; although I doubt there
would be any significant effect because the items indexed (artist and title) are quite
small on their own; finally - if you change this parameter, you need to migrate your index
(see #migrate in utils_elastic.py); if the number was lowered, the bot will function, but
the search results may not work as expected; if the number was increased, the bot will
likely crash when trying to search

Explain = true if you want elasticsearch to explain itself; defaults to false;
explanations will only be visible in the JSON responses, usually DEBUG level logs

Platforms = comma separated list of platforms that will be considered playable; defaults to pc;
CDLCs with only unplayable platforms will not be queued or chosen randomly by the bot

Parts = comma separated list of parts that will be considered playable; defaults to lead & rhythm;
CDLCs with only unplayable parts will not be queued or chosen randomly by the bot

RandomOfficial = true if you want the bot to include all official CDLCs when picking random;
defaults to false

#### [load]

MaxWorkers = amount of background threads that assist with loading CDLCs; defaults to 8;
any positive integer is allowed

#### [irc]

Nick = bot username, account on twitch

Token = oauth token for the bot account; equivalent to password for IRC

Channel = channel to join automatically; this channel will be considered the ADMIN for this bot;
do not use '#', i.e. 'sahyun', not '#sahyun'

MaxWorkers = amount of background threads that performs commands; defaults to 8;
any positive integer is allowed

#### [system]

HttpDebugMode = true if you want to print http headers and stuff to console; defaults to false;
the default logging config should make this obsolete, unless you really wanna see a lot of stuff
in the console for some reason

LoggingConfigFilename = filename which contains logging configuration; defaults to 'config_log_default.ini';
if the defaults are not suitable for you, consider making 'config_log.ini' which is ignored by git

#### [links]

Default = default way to handle links from CDLCs when popping from queue; defaults to 'ignore';
other supported values are 'browse', which opens it in a new browser tab & 'copy' which puts it
into clipboard

#### [commands]

MaxSearch = maximum amount of matches to consider for requests; defaults to 10; any positive number is OK;
does not affect random requests, which pick from the entire matching pool

MaxPick = maximum amount of choices given to user; defaults to 3; any positive number is OK; however,
any number larger than MaxSearch will be effectively pointless, as this number just trims the results
after the search filters out unplayable matches

MaxPrint = maximum amount of playlist items to print; defaults to 5; any positive number is OK

#### [downtime]

Leniency = amount of seconds of downtime that should be ignored; defaults to 1; all values less
than 1 become 1

Unlike the previous sections, this section is dynamic. Each key matches an alias of a command,
and the value is a special string which represents downtime for that command. Downtime only
applies to user roles that are limited (generally, less than VIP).
 
If a command has multiple aliases, and a configuration for multiple of them is provided,
only one of them will be used.
There is no guarantee which one, although the result should be deterministic, i.e.
unless you change the configuration, it will continue to work the same.

The expected format is either an integer, or two integers separated by a colon. All negative
integers will be treated as 0. 0 is equivalent to not providing the configuration.
If the format of downtime is not followed, that setting is simply ignored. Here are a few examples:

###### time = 30

Now !time can only be executed once every 30 seconds. This applies globally - everyone has to wait.
There is no way to grant more than one execution on global level.

###### request = 900:2

Now !request can only be executed twice every 15 minutes. This applies per-user - each user gets
two requests.

###### joke = :5

This is ignored because it does not follow the format.
